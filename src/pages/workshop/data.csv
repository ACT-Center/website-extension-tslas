Ruchika Jain,Appropriated and Assimilated: Ravana in Popular Culture,Tokyo (Online),Asian Conference on Cultural Studies,"The presentation studied the narrativization of the concept of evil/other by studying
variants of Ravana across examples of popular culture in present times—from twenty first century novels and cinema to political rallies and festival fairs. The talk argued that the character of Ravana serves as a platform for expressing dissent and hence in creating (or sustaining) counter-narratives.The talk received the International Academic Forum scholarship. Abstract published in programme ISSN: 2433-7544, pp. 31."
Ruchika Jain,Resurgence of the Ramayana: Polarization or Tradition?,"Texas, USA",Popular Culture Association and American Culture Association,"The research talk explored how recent Ramayana tellings across mediums of popular culture claim to subvert the representative Hindu telling of Ramayana. It asked if these consciously alternate contemporary retellings add to the Ramayana tradition which is known for its quality of plurality and ability to question itself, or if they further politicize and polarize the tradition. Received travel grant. Abstract published in conference booklet page 125."

Agropecuarias (INIA), Chile (Online), 27th - 28th August, 2020","Workshop Ciencia de Insectos Para La Agricultura, Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias (INIA)","Hygienic behavior is a group or social defensive response of honey bees that confers resistance against the honey bee diseases. When nurse bees perceive disease-associated odors coming out of the brood cells, they immediately scrutinize the brood and if required, remove them. This particular and other stable genetic traits are probed in the selective breeding programs worldwide to produce honey bee lines that show substantial resistance against the diseases. Indeed, efforts until now have produced multiple such genetic lines that are significantly more resistant to the diseases compared to the unselected bees.https://araucanianoticias.cl/2020/inia-lidera-workshop-que-aborda-la-relevancia-de-los-insectos-y-su-rol-en-nuestros-ecosistemas/0827187637, https://www.portalagrochile.cl/2020/08/27/inia-lidera-workshop-que-aborda-la-relevancia-de-los-insectos-y-su-rol-en-nuestros-ecosistemas/, http://tierramarillano.cl/2020/08/27/inia-lidera-workshop-que-aborda-la-relevancia-de-los-insectos-y-su-rol-en-nuestros-ecosistemas/"
Neloy Kumar Chakroborty,"Sublethal concentrations of organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides impair the perception and learning of sensory stimuli in the Western honeybee, Apis mellifera","18th COLOSS Congress (eConference), Alabama A&M University, Auburn University, USA, (Online), 2nd - 3rd November 2022",COLOSS Honeybee Research Association,"We assessed the toxicity of these insecticides in the Western honeybee species, Apis mellifera (brought from Italy), domesticated in India. The acute oral median lethal dose values (LD50) after 24 h of administrations were estimated to be 0.39 µg/bee and 0.074 µg/bee respectively for malathion and lambda-cyhalothrin in A. mellifera. This shows that lambda-cyhalothrin is more toxic than malathion in this species of honeybee.https://coloss.org/wp-content/uploads/pastevents/2022Proceedings18th-COLOSS-Conference.pdf"
Rabi Prakash,Political Power and Caste Identity in Pre-Modern India: Changing Discourse on Kshatriya Identity between Jurisprudential and Literary Texts.,"University of Winsconsin-Madison, USA",South Asian Studies Association.,"The presentation suggests, an emergent practice among the political entrepreneurs from different caste groups making their bid to claim kshatriya identity can best be retrieved through their vernacular hagiographies (Carit Kavya) which every significant regional ruler or military enterprenuer got composed for himself. The paper examines a set of hagiographies in Brajbhasha to establish how the Mughal politics of ‘Watan Jagirs’ made the kshatriya as an open category for reclamation through the tool of hagiography which became a complex literary genre drawing upon Puranic narrative, Vaishnava avatar theology and the notions of sacred geography."
Rabi Prakash,"‘Political’ Hagiography
in Vernacular: History and Ideology in Early Modern Brajbhasha /Carit
K?vya/""","Osaka University, Japan",14th International Conference on Early Modern Literatures of Norther India.,"The presentation argues that the composition of political hagiographies emerged not only as an 
important tool for appropriating kshatriya status and reconstructing royal genealogies to bolster 
one’s kshatriya status claim, but also more fundamentally they served as authoritative texts for 
the quest of legitimate political power over a given territory (bhumiy?va?) among the political 
entrepreneurs of 17th and 18th centur"

Rabi Prakash,Explorations in the Conceptual History of R?jn?ti in the Early Modern India,"IISER, Pune",HSS Talk,"In this presentation, I explore the conceptual history of r?jn?ti by reading a set of early Hindi texts that called themselves ‘R?jn?ti’. I would belabor that these vernacular texts in the early modern/later second millennium constituted normative political life laced with the literary imaginations of aesthetic and ethical life. Invoking questions such as what literary genres should the r?jn?ti texts belong to? How do we read these texts in the larger intellectual contexts of devotion (bhakti) and stylistic (r?ti) literary genres? Where do these texts derive their authority from? And what are the cultural receptions of these texts? The presentation would argue that these r?jn?ti texts in early Hindi vernacular inherited longer Sanskritic traditions, built upon the parallel Persian traditions of non-juridical political ethics (akhl?q), and developed a new discourse on political and ethical life that was both desirable and viable for regional political elites."

Saumya Deojain,Unity in Diversity: How Norms of Compromise Enable Cooperation,"Frankfurt, Germany; Milan, Italy; Venice, Italy; Ahmedabad, India",European Economic Assiciation (Bocconi University); Society for Institutional and Organizational Economics (Goethe Institute); University of Venice Ca'Foscari; Ahmedabad University,"I introduce the notion of “norms of compromise” and show that it is essential to understanding the complex relationship between diversity and cooperation documented in the literature. I find that norms of compromise are able to invert the relationship between stable cooperation and different measures of polarization by changing individual risks of leaving the grand coalition. These results highlight the importance of considering the interaction between diversity and culture to establish the causal effects of diversity on cooperation. They also shed light on how norms interact with cooperative efforts in uncertain political environments involving diverse political actors, like social movements."
Saumya Deojain,Diversity Taxes,"Rochester, USA; TSLAS, Patiala",W. Allen Wallis Institute of Political Economy; TSLAS,"The sociological literature suggests that within diverse communities, individuals create externalities on each other when they express their identity through the consumption of market goods. We present a model in which local governments use taxation and individuals adjust their social networks to address these identity expression externalities. We find that taxation and network adjustments act as strategic complements or substitutes, depending on individuals’ preferences for out-group identity expression. Taxes imposed to regulate identity expression externalities amplify the network response to changes in diversity. We analyze US city data on ethnic diversity, taxation, and segregation as outcomes influenced by identity-expression externalities."
Jappen Oberoi,Strategies followed by immigrants to expedite cultural assimilation in early historical India,"Dept. of History, Aggarwal College (M.D. University)","Dept. of History, Aggarwal College (M.D. University)","The Indian subcontinent begirded by mountains, water bodies, and forests, consequently developed its distinctive civilizations and culture. People of foreign extraction fuelled by opportunities of martial acclaim, imperialist cravings, partaking in mercantile opulence, or simply to be in the proximity of a place considered holy in their sectarian belief system certainly overlooked the geographical impediment and took up permanent residence in ancient India, whether they were Yavana immigrants, part of the Scythian Diaspora or the Yuezhi wave. The talk focussed on gathering snippets from the early historical period which reveal the multiple strategies adopted by these immigrants to ease and expedite their assimilation into the Indian socio-cultural milieu and attain acceptance of the native population."
