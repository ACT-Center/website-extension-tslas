      Description: "Hygienic behavior is a group or social defensive response of honey bees that confers resistance against the honey bee diseases. When nurse bees perceive disease-associated odors coming out of the brood cells, they immediately scrutinize the brood and if required, remove them. This particular and other stable genetic traits are probed in the selective breeding programs worldwide to produce honey bee lines that show substantial resistance against the diseases. Indeed, efforts until now have produced multiple such genetic lines that are significantly more resistant to the diseases compared to the unselected bees.https://araucanianoticias.cl/2020/inia-lidera-workshop-que-aborda-la-relevancia-de-los-insectos-y-su-rol-en-nuestros-ecosistemas/0827187637, https://www.portalagrochile.cl/2020/08/27/inia-lidera-workshop-que-aborda-la-relevancia-de-los-insectos-y-su-rol-en-nuestros-ecosistemas/, http://tierramarillano.cl/2020/08/27/inia-lidera-workshop-que-aborda-la-relevancia-de-los-insectos-y-su-rol-en-nuestros-ecosistemas/"

This shows that lambda-cyhalothrin is more toxic than malathion in this species of honeybee.https://coloss.org/wp-content/uploads/pastevents/2022Proceedings18th-COLOSS-Conference.pdf"

I would belabor that these vernacular texts in the early modern/later second millennium constituted normative political life laced with the literary imaginations of aesthetic and ethical life. Invoking questions such as what literary genres should the r?jn?ti texts belong to? How do we read these texts in the larger intellectual contexts of devotion (bhakti) and stylistic (r?ti) literary genres? Where do these texts derive their authority from? And what are the cultural receptions of these texts? The presentation would argue that these r?jn?ti texts in early Hindi vernacular inherited longer Sanskritic traditions, built upon the parallel Persian traditions of non-juridical political ethics (akhl?q), and developed a new discourse on political and ethical life that was both desirable and viable for regional political elites."

      Description: "I introduce the notion of “norms of compromise” and show that it is essential to understanding the complex relationship between diversity and cooperation documented in the literature. I find that norms of compromise are able to invert the relationship between stable cooperation and different measures of polarization by changing individual risks of leaving the grand coalition. These results highlight the importance of considering the interaction between diversity and culture to establish the causal effects of diversity on cooperation. They also shed light on how norms interact with cooperative efforts in uncertain political environments involving diverse political actors, like social movements."

      Description: "The sociological literature suggests that within diverse communities, individuals create externalities on each other when they express their identity through the consumption of market goods. We present a model in which local governments use taxation and individuals adjust their social networks to address these identity expression externalities. We find that taxation and network adjustments act as strategic complements or substitutes, depending on individuals’ preferences for out-group identity expression. Taxes imposed to regulate identity expression externalities amplify the network response to changes in diversity. We analyze US city data on ethnic diversity, taxation, and segregation as outcomes influenced by identity-expression externalities."
